This code demonstrates a 2D shadow casting technique using GameMaker Language (GML) to create "shadows" behind rectangular objects. These shadows are rendered dynamically.
It uses a single light source (multiple light sources will be added in the future) to generate a shadow effect (based on the position of the light source; the player).
